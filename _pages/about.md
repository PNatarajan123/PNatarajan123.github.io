Welcome to my digital realm! I'm Praveen Natarajan, a Computer Engineering student at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://grainger.illinois.edu/). On campus, I am deeply engrossed in technology, data, and solving complex problems. My academic and project work spans Data Structures, Autonomous Vehicles, and Digital Systems, demonstrating my diverse skill set in high level languages like Python, Java, and C++ as well as low level languages like C, SystemVerilog, and LC3 Assembly.

I've contributed significantly to practical projects, including enhancing autonomous navigation algorithms, leading computer vision efforts in robotics, and securing top national honors in cybersecurity competitions. My proficiency in full-stack development and familiarity with collaborative tools like GitHub and VS Code further empower me to turn innovative ideas into reality.

Feel free to explore my portfolio, dive into my project showcases, and reach out if my skills and experiences align with your needs or spark an interest.
