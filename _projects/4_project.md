According to the rule book, it is against the rules to open source team made scripts for the CyberPatriot Competition.

**Section 4009.5:** *"Publicly posting, distributing, or otherwise publicizing scripts, software,or other resources that were created for the CyberPatriot competition or events involving CyberPatriot software is prohibited."*

Therefore, I will list the standings for all CyberPatriot and Capture the Flag competitions I have participated in.
