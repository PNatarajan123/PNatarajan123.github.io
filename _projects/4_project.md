According to the rule book, is against the rules to open source team made scripts for the CyberPatriot Competition.

**Section 4009.5: "Publicly posting, distributing,or otherwise publicizing scripts, software,or other resources that were created for the CyberPatriot competition or events involving CyberPatriot software is prohibited."**
